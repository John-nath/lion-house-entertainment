<h2>Links</h2>
<p>The Site contains links to other Internet websites, including affiliated websites which may or may not be owned or operated by Lion House Entertainment. Lion House Entertainment has not reviewed all of the websites that are linked to the Site, and Lion House Entertainment has no control over such sites. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, Lion House Entertainment is not responsible for the content of such websites, any updates or changes to such sites, or the privacy or other practices of such sites, and the fact that Lion House Entertainment offers such links does not indicate any approval or endorsement of any material contained on any linked site. Lion House Entertainment is providing these links to you only as a convenience. Accordingly, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the terms of use and practices of any linked site. Further, it is up to you to take precautions to ensure that whatever links you select or software you download (whether from the Site or other sites) is free of such items as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, defects, date bombs, time bombs and other items of a destructive nature.

YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF OTHER INTERNET WEBSITES AND RESOURCES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR USE OF ANY CONTENT, INFORMATION, DATA, ADVERTISING, PRODUCTS, OR OTHER MATERIALS ON OR AVAILABLE THROUGH SUCH WEBSITES AND RESOURCES, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE APPLICABLE TO SUCH SITES AND RESOURCES.</p>
<h2>Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by Lion House Entertainment infringe your copyright (for example, materials posted by Lion House Entertainment on one of our Forums), you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Lion House Entertainment to locate the material on the Site; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Additionally, if you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed by Lion House Entertainment against you, the DMCA permits you to send Lion House Entertainment a counter-notice.

Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright/ for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site should be sent to Lion House Entertainment LLC, 9348 Civic Center Drive, Beverly Hills, CA 90210, (310) 867-7000, copyright@lionhouseentertainment.com. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
<h2>Access By Minors</h2>
<p>Lion House Entertainment cannot prohibit minors from visiting this site. Lion House Entertainment must rely on parents, guardians and those responsible for supervising children under 13 to decide which materials are appropriate for such children to view and/or purchase. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230 (d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available on the two websites GetNetWise http://kids.getnetwise.org and OnGuard Online http://onguardonline.gov. Please note that Lion House Entertainment does not endorse any of the products or services listed at such websites.</p>
